    <h4>
      Points
    </h4>
    <p>Points are a visualization  of a place in space. It has no width, no height, and is the basis for complex shapes.<br>
    Points at the base of an angle are called a vertex.</p>

      Lines, Rays, and Segments
    </h4>
    <p>Lines are a visualization between two points. Any two points can form a line. They extend forever and can intersect with other lines to form new points.There are also two variations of lines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Rays are a special type of line that only extends forever in one direction.</p><br></li>
        <li><p>A segment is another special type of line that does not extend forever and is a set distance.</p><br></li>
      </ul>
    <p>A line can be made up of a combination of rays and segments. Two intersecting lines can also form new rays and segments.</p>

    <h4>
      Angles
    </h4>
    <p>Angles is the distance between two lines at the vertex. It is measured in degrees or radians. Any two intersecting lines can form new angles, but angles are commonly represented by two rays that share a point.<br></p>
